					We are a small business that is not part of a chain, and we do not have delivery! We operate mainly with in person help, so please keep that in mind! Additionally, we encourage you to support as many local sellers as you can, because they really need it. Its very important to consider the people you live around and how you can help everyone in your community get better! Thank you so much for visiting our website! We hope you have a great day and swing by soon!
