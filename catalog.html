			<div class="catalogSubmainOne" style="grid-area: 1 / 1 / span 2 / span 1;"><img src="assets/challahBread.jpg" alt="Challah bread being sliced to show inside." class="catalogImgOne"><div class="catalogTextOne">Challah or hallah, also known as berches in Central Europe, is a special bread in Jewish cuisine, usually braided and typically eaten on ceremonial occasions such as Shabbat and major Jewish holidays (other than Passover). It shares many similarities with brioche bread, especially ingredient wise. It does not, however, contain any dairy, like brioche often does. This is in order for the bread to stay pareve, or having no meat or dairy.</div></div>
			<div class="catalogSubmainTwo" style="grid-area: 1 / 2 / span 2 / span 1;"><div class="catalogTextTwo">Focaccia is a flat leavened oven-baked Italian bread. It is best characterized by small dimples in its surface, a coating of olive oil, and being topped with rosemary or other herbs. It is used in sandwiches and as a dish of its own, and is sometimes combined with other ingredients, such as tomatoes or cheese to cook with it to make it its own dish.</div><img src="assets/leFocaccia.jpg" alt="Fresh Focaccia bread." class="catalogImgTwo"></div>
			<div class="catalogSubmainOne" style="grid-area: 3 / 1 / span 2 / span 1;"><img src="assets/sourdough.jpg" alt="Sliced loaf of sourdough bread." class="catalogImgOne"><div class="catalogTextOne">Sourdough or sourdough bread is a bread made by allowing the dough to ferment before baking. In addition to leavening the bread, the fermentation process produces lactic acid, which gives the bread a sour taste and improves its keeping-qualities. It was actually the common way of making bread throughout most of history, until around the Middle Ages.</div></div>
			<div class="catalogSubmainTwo" style="grid-area: 3 / 2 / span 2 / span 1;"><div class="catalogTextTwo">Rye bread is a type of bread made with various proportions of flour from rye grain. It can be light or dark in color, depending on the type of flour used and the addition of coloring agents, and is typically denser than bread made from wheat flour. Compared to white bread, it is higher in fiber, darker in color, and stronger in flavor. The world's largest exporter of rye bread is Poland.</div><img src="assets/ryeBread.jpg" alt="Loaf of rye bread." class="catalogImgTwo"></div>
			<div class="catalogSubmainOne" style="grid-area: 5 / 1 / span 2 / span 1;"><img src="assets/briocheBread.jpg" alt="Brioche" class="catalogImgOne"><div class="catalogTextOne">Brioche is a bread of French origin whose high egg and butter content gives it a rich and tender crumb. It is considered a type of French pastery because of its rich texture and taste, but is made in the same way that bread is. It gets its fluffiness from extra ingredients such as butter and milk that might not be found in every single type of bread.</div></div>
