It shares many similarities with brioche bread, especially ingredient wise. It does not, however, contain any dairy, like brioche often does. This is in order for the bread to stay pareve, or having no meat or dairy.</div></div>
			<div class="catalogSubmainTwo" style="grid-area: 1 / 2 / span 2 / span 1;"><div class="catalogTextTwo">Focaccia is a flat leavened oven-baked Italian bread. It is best characterized by small dimples in its surface, a coating of olive oil, and being topped with rosemary or other herbs. It is used in sandwiches and as a dish of its own, and is sometimes combined with other ingredients, such as tomatoes or cheese to cook with it to make it its own dish.</div><img src="assets/leFocaccia.jpg" alt="Fresh Focaccia bread." class="catalogImgTwo"></div>
			<div class="catalogSubmainOne" style="grid-area: 3 / 1 / span 2 / span 1;"><img src="assets/sourdough.jpg" alt="Sliced loaf of sourdough bread." class="catalogImgOne"><div class="catalogTextOne">Sourdough or sourdough bread is a bread made by allowing the dough to ferment before baking. In addition to leavening the bread, the fermentation process produces lactic acid, which gives the bread a sour taste and improves its keeping-qualities. It was actually the common way of making bread throughout most of history, until around the Middle Ages.</div></div>
			<div class="catalogSubmainTwo" style="grid-area: 3 / 2 / span 2 / span 1;"><div class="catalogTextTwo">Rye bread is a type of bread made with various proportions of flour from rye grain. It can be light or dark in color, depending on the type of flour used and the addition of coloring agents, and is typically denser than bread made from wheat flour. Compared to white bread, it is higher in fiber, darker in color, and stronger in flavor. The world's largest exporter of rye bread is Poland.</div><img src="assets/ryeBread.jpg" alt="Loaf of rye bread." class="catalogImgTwo"></div>
			<div class="catalogSubmainOne" style="grid-area: 5 / 1 / span 2 / span 1;"><img src="assets/briocheBread.jpg" alt="Partially sliced loaf of brioche" class="catalogImgOne"><div class="catalogTextOne">Brioche is a bread of French origin whose high egg and butter content gives it a rich and tender crumb. It is considered a type of French pastery because of its rich texture and taste, but is made in the same way that bread is. It gets its fluffiness from extra ingredients such as butter and milk that might not be found in every single type of bread.</div></div>
			<div class="catalogSubmainTwo" style="grid-area: 5 / 2 / span 2 / span 1;"><div class="catalogTextTwo">Ciabattais an Italian white bread created in 1982 by a baker in Adria, Veneto, in response to the popularity of French baguettes. Ciabatta is somewhat elongated, broad, and flat, and is baked in many variations, although unique for its alveolar holes. Ciabatta is made with a strong flour and uses a very high hydration dough. It got its name for its flat shape, Ciabatta meaning 'carpet slipper' in Italian.</div><img src="assets/ciabattaBread.jpg" alt="Slices of ciabatta bread" class="catalogImgTwo"></div>
			<div class="catalogSubmainOne" style="grid-area: 7 / 1 / span 2 / span 1;"><img src="assets/pumpernickel.jpg" alt="Pumpernickel leaf of bread in slices." class="catalogImgOne"><div class="catalogTextOne">Pumpernickel is a typically dense, slightly sweet rye bread traditionally made with sourdough starter and coarsely ground rye. It is sometimes made with a combination of rye flour and whole rye grains. Basically, it is a combination of dark rye bread and sourdough. Its name is assumed to have come from an insult, depicting the bread as negative. Pumpernickel has been long associated with the Westphalia region of Germany, first referred to in print in 1450.</div></div>
